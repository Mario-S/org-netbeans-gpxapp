# Software Requirements #

You simply just need one thing: `NetBeans`.

However it should be the version 7.2, because another one isn't tested yet.

I also recommend to install a Mercurial client.

## New to the `NetBeans` RCP ##

If you are new to the platform this is a good resource for more informations:

## Visual Editor ##

The GUI of the views are made with `NetBeans` GUI Builder.

### Data Binding ###

The GUI Builder provides support for the JSR 295 Beans binding. More details provide those links:
